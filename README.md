Next you will want to install table plus to use as a GUI to view the mysql server. You can find the download link here: https://tableplus.com

Next you will connect table plus to your created local mysql server. There are instructions on how to do that here: https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/09/getting-started-with-mysql-on-mac.html

You need to create a database called “online_bookstore” in table plus

Next you need to import the data_dump.sql file found in the folder. This can be done by doing file import in table plus. This will import all of the tables and functions

Now we need to set up a php server on our computer. The instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://medium.com/@soufianerafik/setting-up-php-7-on-macos-high-sierra-714594eadbbe

Once you set up the server and a default folder. Transfer all of the .html files and .php files in the webpage folder to this default folder.

Go to a browser and type in localhost and the login screen for the webpage will come up. Then just sign in or register and use the server
